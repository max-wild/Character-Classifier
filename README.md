# Classifying Alphanumeric Characters

Hi, I built a convolutional neural network in PyTorch and trained it to classify characters. I created it to have 4 convolutional layers, 2 max pooling layers, and 1 linear layer, and it was inspired by the pre-existing TinyVGG CNN architecture. It took about 40 minutes to train with the EMNIST dataset on Google Colab.

You can try it yourself with the [live demo on my website here.](https://maxwild.live/models)

Check out the Google Colab notebook I built and trained it on [here!](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WoXlmQV2LVgVh0HWFbvprU5Zlp3vFW9Z?usp=sharing) (or look at the .ipynb file in this repo)

Thanks for checking it out, take care ðŸ‘‹
